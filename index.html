  <h3>About me.</h3>
  <p>I have been a Skilled Tradesmen (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG9NpBoL8ns">Tool and Die Maker</a>) for the last 22 years perfecting and honing my skills because that is what paid the bills, and that was my chosen career - or rather
    it was a job that was offered to me at a yung age and I ended staying with it. I
    have been interested in computers sence they were 1st avaliable to the consumer. How they work and what makes them go. I have been using computers sence the 80's starting with my 1st computer a <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSaAZAYh1UI">Tandy 1000</a> and also with my friends <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/c64.html">Commodore 64</a>. I
    understood C: and dos enough to launch programs. Fast forward to the erly 2000's and the time of AOL where I remember building a profile and personal homepage and thu lots of looking up how to's I built an interactive page with multiple linked
    pages, 8
    bit
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iu3ePwhlNEo">midi</a> music and I changed the look of your curser. I also blocked my page so that if someone tried to right click and save any of my pictures you got a popup window that somewhat insulted
    your feeble attempt at trying to take my hard work. I never
    realized really what I was dooing or that I could even make a living dooing that type of stuff... Untill now. Yes I may be late to the game, but my interest has never died. I have decided to go after something that has always been burning in the
    back of my mind.</p>
